    <p>The HCPSS is committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for
    all students. Preventing bullying is an important part of this goal.</p>

    <p>Through initiatives, such as Positive Behavioral Interventions and
    Supports (PBIS), social emotional learning, and restorative justice;
    students learn conflict resolution and assertiveness skills while further
    developing empathy and building trust and relationships. Professional
    development for staff and information provided for families also assist us
    in our efforts to keep students safe from bullying and harassment.</p>

    <p>If you believe your child is being bullied, please refer to the
    Student/Parent Handbook available on the website or at your child’s school.
    In addition, please be sure to complete a Bullying, Cyberbullying,
    Harassment, or Intimidation on our <a href="/report/bullying">reporting
    page</a>. By working together, we can prevent bullying.</p>

    <h2 id="definition">Definition of Bullying</h2>

    <p>Intentional conduct, including verbal, physical or written conduct, or an
    intentional electronic communication that creates a hostile educational
    environment by substantially interfering with a student or staff member’s
    educational benefits, opportunities or performance, or with their physical
    or psychological well-being. Intentional conduct is also considered bullying
    if it:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Is motivated by an actual or perceived personal characteristic
      including race, national origin, marital status, sex, sexual orientation,
      gender identity, religion, ancestry, physical attributes, socioeconomic
      status, familial status, or physical or mental ability or disability.</li>

      <li>Is threatening or seriously intimidating.</li>

      <li>Occurs on school property, at a school activity or event, or on a
      school bus; or, substantially disrupts the orderly operation of a school
      or workplace.</li>

    <p>Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS). It is a nationally
    recognized and research based process that supports positive learning
    environments. PBIS is a framework or approach for assisting school personnel
    in adopting and organizing evidence-based behavioral interventions into an
    integrated continuum through defining, teaching, and acknowledging
    behavioral expectations. By reinforcing positive behaviors, schools find
    that teachers spend more time teaching, as class disruptions, office
    referrals and suspensions are reduced.</p>

    <p>PBIS is not a packaged curriculum, a scripted intervention, or a
    stand-alone strategy. PBIS is a prevention-oriented way for school personnel
    to (a) organize evidence-based practices, (b) improve their implementation
    of those practices using data, and (c) maximize academic and social behavior
    outcomes for students. PBIS supports the success of all students.</p>

    <p>PBIS uses a three-tiered prevention logic that requires all students to
    receive supports at the universal or primary tier. If the behavior of some
    students is not responsive, more intensive behavioral supports, (targeted or
    secondary tier) or a highly individualized plan (intensive or tertiary tier)
    are provided.

    <p>The Howard County Public School System has been involved in PBIS since
    the 1999-2000 school year. Currently 55 of the 74 Howard County public
    schools participate in the PBIS initiative. Please visit your child’s school
    website or contact the school for specific information about PBIS in that
    school. <a href="https://www.hcpss.org/parents/pbis/#list">See a list of
